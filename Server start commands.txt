For Local development
=========================
1. First start node.js signalling server
	D:\GST apps\send-anywhere-lite\server> node .\server.js  

2. Secondly, start the frontend with npm command
	D:\GST apps\send-anywhere-lite\client> npm run dev


==============================
For remote deployment
==============================
1. Commit your code and push to GitHub. It auto deploys frontend on Vercel and backend on Render.
	frontend: https://send-anywhere-lite.vercel.app/
	backend: https://send-anywhere-lite.onrender.com

2. Since, Render auto sleeps the backend signalling server post 15 minutes of activity, I have added 
a GitHub action to ping "https://send-anywhere-lite.onrender.com/health" every 13 minutes to keep the app alive.
